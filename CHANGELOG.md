# CHANGELOG

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.33.1] - 2025-03-12

### Fixed

- @cosmjs/crypto: Bump elliptic version to ^6.6.1 due to
  [GHSA-vjh7-7g9h-fjfh](https://github.com/indutny/elliptic/security/advisories/GHSA-vjh7-7g9h-fjfh).

## [0.33.0] - 2025-01-15

### Changed

- Upgrade to yarn 4 and drop Node.js 16 support ([#1552])
- @cosmjs/stargate: Removed support for verified queries. This feature depends
  on a JavaScript implementation of ICS-23 but
  [@confio/ics23 is unmaintained](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmjs/issues/1618)
  without replacement.
- @cosmjs/proto-signing: Upgrade protobufjs to 7.4.

[#1552]: https://github.com/cosmos/cosmjs/issues/1552

## [0.32.4] - 2024-06-26

### Fixed

- @cosmjs/tendermint-rpc: fix node info check to accept empty string on channels
  field ([#1591])

### Added

- @cosmjs/stargate: Add support for `MsgCancelUnbondingDelegation` ([#1535])

[#1535]: https://github.com/cosmos/cosmjs/pull/1535

### Changed

- @cosmjs/stargate, @cosmjs/cosmwasm-stargate: Synchronize the default gas
  multiplier value between the `signAndBroadcast` and `signAndBroadcastSync`
  methods so that it is equal to 1.4 everywhere. ([#1584])

## [0.32.3] - 2024-03-08

### Changed

- @cosmjs/amino: Add IBC denom support to `parseCoins` and use the same
  implementation in all those imports:

  ```ts
  import { parseCoins } from "@cosmjs/proto-signing";
  // equals
  import { parseCoins } from "@cosmjs/stargate";
  // equals
  import { parseCoins } from "@cosmjs/amino";
  ```

- @cosmjs/stargate: Let `parseRawLog` gracefully handle empty strings to better
  support Cosmos SDK 0.50 inputs. ([#1564])

[#1564]: https://github.com/cosmos/cosmjs/pull/1564

### Fixed

- @cosmjs/encoding: Avoid using replacement character in doc comment to make
  external tools happy. ([#1570])
- @cosmjs/cosmwasm-stargate: Use events instead of log parsing to receive
  information in SigningCosmWasmClient. This is required to support Cosmos SDK
  0.50+ where the `rawLog` field is empty. ([#1564])

[#1564]: https://github.com/cosmos/cosmjs/pull/1564
[#1570]: https://github.com/cosmos/cosmjs/pull/1570

## [0.32.2] - 2023-12-19

### Fixed

- @cosmjs/stargate: Update validation of `GasPrice.fromString` to allow using
  IBC denoms as gas denom. ([#1522])

[#1522]: https://github.com/cosmos/cosmjs/pull/1522

### Changed

- @cosmjs/tendermint-rpc: Require protocol to be set in endpoint URLs (https://,
  http://, wss:// or ws://). Otherwise an error is raised instead of falling
  back to ws://. ([#1527])

[#1527]: https://github.com/cosmos/cosmjs/pull/1527

## [0.32.1] - 2023-12-04

### Fixed

- @cosmjs/encoding: Ensure RFC dates between years 0001 and 0099 are parsed
  correctly. ([#1516])
- @cosmjs/tendermint-rpc: Remove hacky `decodeOptionalTime()` from adaptors now
  that `time.Time` dates are parsed correctly. ([#1516])

[#1516]: https://github.com/cosmos/cosmjs/pull/1516

## [0.32.0] - 2023-11-23

### Added

- @cosmjs/stargate and @cosmjs/cosmwasm-stargate:
  `sign`/`signAndBroadcast`/`signAndBroadcastSync` and related functions now
  have an additional parameter to specify the timeout height. After this height,
  a signed transaction will be considered invalid by the chain. ([#1489])
- @cosmjs/amino: Export `omitDefault` to help build Amino JSON converters.

[#1489]: https://github.com/cosmos/cosmjs/pull/1489

### Fixed

- @cosmjs/stargate: Handle key value pairs in tx search correctly if the value
  is a numeric value. ([#1462])
- @cosmjs/cosmwasm-stargate: Make `fix_msg` optional in
  `AminoMsgInstantiateContract2` and omit default in the Amino JSON converter to
  fix Amino JSON signing for MsgInstantiateContract2. ([#1509])

[#1462]: https://github.com/cosmos/cosmjs/issues/1462
[#1509]: https://github.com/cosmos/cosmjs/pull/1509

### Changed

- all: Upgrade cosmjs-types to 0.9.0. This makes a few fields non-optional. It
  changes all 64 bit int fields from type `long` to `bigint`. As part of the
  upgrade, the types do not require the `long` and `protobufjs` anymore.
  ([#1484])
- all: `gasWanted`/`gasUsed` fields were changed from type `number` to `bigint`
  to supported cases where users put very high gas values in there ([#1465]).
- Drop support for Node.js 14 and add support for Node.js 20. ([#1421])
- @cosmjs/tendermint-rpc: Remove `Adaptor` abstractions which are not needed
  anymore by haing a dedicated client for each backend.
- @cosmjs/tendermint-rpc: Add
  `CometClient = Tendermint34Client | Tendermint37Client | Comet38Client` and
  `connectComet` for auto-detecting the right client for a provided endpoint.
- @cosmjs/stargate: Let `SigningStargateClient.createWithSigner` and
  `StargateClient.create` take a `CometClient` argument, adding support for
  `Comet38Client`. The auto-detection in
  `SigningStargateClient.connectWithSigner` and `StargateClient.connect` now
  supports CometBFT 0.38. Rename
  `StargateClient.getTmClient`/`.forceGetTmClient` to
  `.getCometClient`/`.forceGetCometClient`.
- @cosmjs/cosmwasm-stargate: Let `SigningCosmWasmClient.createWithSigner` and
  `CosmWasmClient.create` take a `CometClient` argument, adding support for
  `Comet38Client`. The auto-detection in
  `SigningCosmWasmClient.connectWithSigner` and `CosmWasmClient.connect` now
  supports CometBFT 0.38. Rename
  `CosmWasmClient.getTmClient`/`.forceGetTmClient` to
  `.getCometClient`/`.forceGetCometClient`.
- @cosmjs/stargate: Remove interfaces `SearchBySentFromOrToQuery` and
  `SearchByHeightQuery` which became obsolete with the `searchTx` change in
  0.31.0.

[#1421]: https://github.com/cosmos/cosmjs/issues/1421
[#1465]: https://github.com/cosmos/cosmjs/issues/1465
[#1484]: https://github.com/cosmos/cosmjs/pull/1484

### Deprecated

- @cosmjs/tendermint-rpc: `CometClient` should be used instead of
  `TendermintClient`.
- @cosmjs/stargate: Deprecate `SigningStargateClient.sendIbcTokens`. Please use
  `signAndBroadcast` + `MsgTransferEncodeObject` instead. ([#1493])
- @cosmjs/stargate: Deprecate `IndexedTx.rawLog` and `DeliverTxResponse.rawLog`
  because those fields are unset from Cosmos SDK 0.50 onwards (see
  [here](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/15845)).

[#1493]: https://github.com/cosmos/cosmjs/issues/1493

## [0.31.3] - 2023-10-25

### Fixed

- @cosmjs/stargate: Add missing memo field to `fromAmino` implementation for
  `MsgTransfer`. ([#1493])

  `SigningCosmWasmClient.upload` to 1.1. ([#1360])

[#1360]: https://github.com/cosmos/cosmjs/issues/1360

## [0.31.0] - 2023-06-22

### Fixed

- @cosmjs/crypto: Migrate to `libsodium-wrappers-sumo` to be able to use the
  `crypto_pwhash` functions ([#1429]).

  types.
- @cosmjs/cosmwasm-stargate: Implement auto-detection for Tendermint 0.34/37
  ([#1411]).
- @cosmjs/cosmwasm-stargate: Remove structured `searchTx` queries. Only raw
  query strings and key/value pairs are now supported. ([#1411])
- @cosmjs/cosmwasm-stargate: Let `searchTx` return non-readonly array. The
  caller owns this array and can mutate it as they want. ([#1411])

## [0.30.1] - 2023-03-22

### Fixed

- @cosmjs/amino: Fix escaping of "&", "<" and ">" characters in Amino JSON
  encoding to match the Go implementation ([#1373], [#1388]).

  this was also deleted. ([#1291])
- @cosmjs/proto-signing: Remove `fromJSON`/`toJSON` from `TsProtoGeneratedType`
  such that generated types are not required to generate those anymore. The
  methods were provided by ts-proto but we never needed them. ([#1329])
- @cosmjs/stargate: Rename `fromTendermint34Event` to `fromTendermintEvent` and
  let it support both Tendermint 0.34 and 0.37 events as input.
- @cosmjs/cosmwasm-stargate: Remove `cosmWasmTypes`. Use

- @cosmjs/encoding: Remove previously deprecated `Bech32` class. Please replace
  `Bech32.encode`/`.decode` with free the functions `toBech32`/`fromBech32`.
- @cosmjs/cosmwasm-stargate: Changed the `SigningCosmWasmClient` constructor to
  include all Amino type converters that the `SigningStargateClient` uses by

[#1326]: https://github.com/cosmos/cosmjs/pull/1326

### Changed

- @cosmjs/crypto: `getSubtle()` does not use `getCryptoModule()` anymore to find
  a subtle implementation. Turns out all environments we support have subtle in

  TypeScript-friendly way.
- @cosmjs/stargate: Add missing `{is,}MsgBeginRedelegateEncodeObject`,

## [0.28.9] - 2022-06-21

This version replaces the 0.28.8 release which was erroneously tagged as 0.26.8
and released to npm under that wrong version. In order to avoid further
confusion we give up the .8 patch version. Users should install `^0.28.9` for
all `@cosmjs/*` packages to be safe. Users of `^0.26` should upgrade to a more
recent minor version if they run into trouble.

## [0.28.8] - 2022-06-21

## [0.28.0] - 2022-03-17

### Changed

- all: The TypeScript compilation target is now ES2018.
- @cosmjs/crypto: Add `Secp256k1.uncompressPubkey`.
- @cosmjs/crypto: Replace hashing implementations with @noble/hashes ([#960]).
- @cosmjs/faucet: Set default value of `FAUCET_GAS_LIMIT` to 100_000 to better
  support Cosmos SDK 0.45 chains.
- @cosmjs/stargate: The `AminoTypes` now always requires an argument of type
  `AminoTypesOptions`. This is an object with a required `prefix` field. Before
  the prefix defaulted to "cosmos" but this is almost never the right choice for
  CosmJS users that need to add Amino types manually. ([#989])
- @cosmjs/cosmwasm-stargate: `height`, `gasWanted` and `gasUsed` have been added
  to all result types of `SigningCosmWasmClient`
- @cosmjs/stargate: `MsgSend` and `Coin` are now parts of
  `defaultRegistryTypes`. ([#994])
- @cosmjs/proto-signing: `Registry`'s constructor can now override default
  types. ([#994])
- @cosmjs/tendermint-rpc: The property `evidence` in the interface `Block` is
  now non-optional. ([#1011])
- @cosmjs/stargate: Added the following message types to stargate's
  `defaultRegistryTypes`: ([#1026])
  - cosmos.authz.v1beta1.MsgGrant
  - cosmos.authz.v1beta1.MsgExec
  - cosmos.authz.v1beta1.MsgRevoke
  - cosmos.feegrant.v1beta1.MsgGrantAllowance
  - cosmos.feegrant.v1beta1.MsgRevokeAllowance
- @cosmjs/stargate: In `AminoTypes` the uniqueness of the Amino type identifier
  is checked in `fromAmino` now instead of the constructor. This only affects
  you if multiple different protobuf type URLs map to the same Amino type
  identifier which should not be the case anyways.
- @cosmjs/stargate: Added support for slashing queries ([#927])
- @cosmjs/ledger-amino: Renamed `LaunchpadLedger` to `LedgerConnector` ([#955])
- @cosmjs/encoding: Created `toBech32()` and `fromBech32()`. Class Bech32 is now
  deprecated and should not longer be used. ([#1053])
- @cosmjs/crypto: Use a custom BIP-39 implementation to reduce external
  dependencies. This should also reduce the bundle size as only the English
  wordlist is shipped. ([#966])
- @cosmjs/cli: Rename binary `cosmwasm-cli` to `cosmjs-cli` ([#1033]).
- @cosmjs/stargate: Added Authz queries. ([#1080]).
- @cosmjs/stargate & @cosmjs/cosmwasm-stargate: Removed default types from
  AminoTypes. ([#1079])
- @cosmjs/cosmwasm-stargate: getCodes() automatically loops through all
  pagination pages now. ([#1077])
- @cosmjs/stargate & @cosmjs/cosmwasm-stargate: Timeout Errors shows more
  relevant information about the timeout. ([#1066])

### Removed

- @cosmjs/crypto: Remove the SHA1 implementation (`Sha1` and `sha1`) as it is
  not used in the Cosmos tech stack and not implemented in the hashing lib we
  want to migrate to ([#1003]). Also it has known weaknesses.
- @cosmjs/launchpad: Package was removed as no support for Cosmos SDK 0.37-0.39
  is needed anymore ([#947]).

[#947]: https://github.com/cosmos/cosmjs/issues/947
[#1003]: https://github.com/cosmos/cosmjs/issues/1003

## [0.27.1] - 2022-01-26

### Added

- @cosmjs/cosmwasm-stargate: Add `fromBinary`/`toBinary` to convert between
  JavaScript objects and the JSON representation of `cosmwasm_std::Binary`
  (base64).
- @cosmjs/cosmwasm-stargate: Export `WasmExtension` and `setupWasmExtension`.
- @cosmjs/ledger-amino: Added `LedgerSigner.showAddress` and
  `LaunchpadLedger.showAddress` to show the user's address in the Ledger screen.

### Changed

- @cosmjs/stargate: The error messages for missing types in `AminoTypes` now
  contain the type that was searched for ([#990]).
- @cosmjs/tendermint-rpc: Change the `Evidence` type to `any` and avoid decoding
  it. The structure we had before was outdated and trying to decode it led to
  exceptions at runtime when a block with actual values was encountered.
  ([#980])

[#990]: https://github.com/cosmos/cosmjs/pull/990
[#980]: https://github.com/cosmos/cosmjs/issues/980

## [0.27.0] - 2022-01-10

### Added

- @cosmjs/tendermint-rpc: Add `hash` field to `BroadcastTxAsyncResponse`
  ([#938]).
- @cosmjs/stargate: Add `denomMetadata` and `denomsMetadata` to `BankExtension`
  ([#932]).
- @cosmjs/stargate: Merge `DeliverTxFailure` and `DeliverTxSuccess` into a
  single `DeliverTxResponse` ([#878], [#949]). Add `assertIsDeliverTxFailure`.
- @cosmjs/stargate: Created initial `MintExtension`.
- @cosmjs/stargate: Created `types.Dec` decoder function
  `decodeCosmosSdkDecFromProto`.
- @cosmjs/amino: Added `StdTx`, `isStdTx` and `makeStdTx` and removed them from
  @cosmjs/launchpad. They are re-exported in @cosmjs/launchpad for backwards
  compatibility.
- @cosmjs/stargate: Add `GasPrice.toString`.
- @cosmjs/faucet: Added a new functionality to faucet: Each address is only
  allowed to get credits once every 24h to prevent draining. ([#962]))

### Fixed

- @cosmjs/tendermint-rpc: Add missing `BlockSearchResponse` case to `Response`.

### Changed

- @cosmjs/stargate: Remove verified queries from `AuthExtension` and
  `BankExtension` as well as `StargateClient.getAccountVerified` because the
  storage layout is not stable across multiple Cosmos SDK releases. Verified
  queries remain available in the `IbcExtension` because for IBC the storage
  layout is standardized. Such queries can still be implemented in CosmJS caller
  code that only needs to support one backend. ([#865])
- @cosmjs/tendermint-rpc: Remove default URL from `HttpClient` and
  `WebsocketClient` constructors ([#897]).
- all: Upgrade cosmjs-types to 0.4. This includes the types of the Cosmos SDK
  0.44 modules x/authz and x/feegrant. It causes a few breaking changes by
  adding fields to interfaces as well as changing `Date` to a `Timestamp`
  object. ([#928])
- @cosmjs/stargate and @cosmjs/cosmwasm-stargate: Add simulation support
  ([#931]).
- @cosmjs/cosmwasm-stargate: Rename `BroadcastTx{Success,Failure}` to
  `DeliverTx{Success,Failure}`, `BroadcastTxResponse` to `DeliverTxResponse`,
  `isBroadcastTx{Success,Failure}` to `isDeliverTx{Success,Failure}` and
  `assertIsBroadcastTxSuccess` to `assertIsDeliverTxSuccess`. ([#946])
- @cosmjs/tendermint-rpc: Remove `Tendermint33Client` and related symbols.
- @cosmjs/cosmwasm-stargate: Add support for wasmd 0.21. This changes the AMINO
  JSON representation of `Msg{Execute,Instantiate,Migrate}Contract.msg` from
  base64 strings to JSON objects. ([#948])
- @cosmjs/cli: Replace `colors` dependency with `chalk` (see
  https://snyk.io/blog/open-source-npm-packages-colors-faker/)

## [0.26.5] - 2021-11-20

### Added

- @cosmjs/amino: The `coin` and `coins` helpers now support both `number` and
  `string` as input types for the amount. This is useful if your values exceed
  the safe integer range.

### Fixed

- @cosmjs/tendermint-rpc: Fix undefined `this` in `decodeBroadcastTxAsync` and
  `broadcastTxAsync` ([#937]).

### Fixed

- @cosmjs/cosmwasm-stargate: Fix response error handling for smart queries.

## [0.26.3] - 2021-10-25

### Added

- @cosmjs/ledger-amino: Add support for using forks of the Cosmos Ledger app by
  adding the fields `LaunchpadLedgerOptions.ledgerAppName` and
  `.minLedgerAppVersion`.

### Deprecated

- @cosmjs/stargate: The verified queries from `AuthExtension` and
  `BankExtension` as well as `StargateClient.getAccountVerified` are deprecated
  and will be removed in 0.27 ([#910]).

[#910]: https://github.com/cosmos/cosmjs/pull/910

## [0.26.2] - 2021-10-12

### Fixed

- @cosmjs/stargate: remove extra space in messageTimeout registry.
- @cosmjs/cosmwasm-stargate: Fix Amino JSON representation of
  `MsgInstantiateContract`, `MsgMigrateContract` and `MsgExecuteContract` to
  match the wasmd expectation. This was broken since the wasmd upgrade to
  Stargate such that no Ledger signing was possible for those message types in
  the meantime.

## [0.26.1] - 2021-09-30

### Added

- @cosmjs/amino: `decodeBech32Pubkey` and `decodeAminoPubkey` now support
  decoding multisig public keys ([#882]).

### Fixed

- @cosmjs/stargate: Add missing pagination key arguments to query types in
  `GovExtension`.

[#882]: https://github.com/cosmos/cosmjs/issues/882

## [0.26.0] - 2021-08-24

### Added

  for Tendermint v0.33.
- @cosmjs/tendermint-rpc: Exports relating to `Tendermint33Client` are now
  available under `tendermint33`.
- @cosmjs/proto-signing and @cosmjs/stargate: Create a Stargate-ready
  `parseCoins` that replaces the `parseCoins` re-export from `@cosmjs/amino`.
- @cosmjs/cosmwasm-stargate: Export `isValidBuilder`, which is a clone of
  `isValidBuilder` from @cosmjs/cosmwasm-launchpad.
- @cosmjs/cosmwasm-stargate: Copy symbols `Code`, `CodeDetails`, `Contract`,
  `ContractCodeHistoryEntry` and `JsonObject` from @cosmjs/cosmwasm-launchpad
  and remove dependency on @cosmjs/cosmwasm-launchpad.

  configure the HD path of the faucet accounts ([#832]).
- @cosmjs/cosmwasm-stargate: Add field `ibcPortId` to `Contract` ([#836]).
- @cosmjs/stargate: Add `GovExtension` for query client.

  `InstantiateOptions` (accepted as a parameter to
  `SigningCosmWasmClient.instantiate`) has been renamed to `funds`.
- @cosmjs/cosmwasm-stargate: Default fee/gas values have been removed. Fees now
  need to be calculated and passed to `SigningCosmWasmClient` when calling any
  methods which submit transactions to the blockchain.
- @cosmjs/stargate: Default fee/gas values have been removed. Fees now need to
  be calculated and passed to `SigningStargateClient` when calling any methods
  which submit transactions to the blockchain.
- @cosmjs/tendermint-rpc: Make `tendermint34.Header.lastBlockId` and
  `tendermint34.Block.lastCommit` optional to better handle the case of height 1
  where there is no previous block.
- @cosmjs/proto-signing: `makeAuthInfoBytes` now takes an array of pubkey
  sequence pairs in order to support different sequences for different signers.
- @cosmjs/cosmwasm-stargate: Upgraded client to support wasmd 0.18 backends.
  Other backends are not supported anymore. Update proto types from
  `cosmwasm.wasm.v1beta1.*` to `cosmwasm.wasm.v1.*`. `MsgStoreCode.source` and
  `MsgStoreCode.builder` were removed; `MsgInstantiateContract.initMsg` and
  `MsgMigrateContract.migrateMsg` were renamed to `msg`; `Code.{source,builder}`
  and `CodeDetails.{source,builder}` were removed; `isValidBuilder` was removed;

## [0.25.5] - 2021-06-23

### Added

- @cosmjs/tendermint-rpc: `Tendermint34Client.blockSearch` and
  `Tendermint34Client.blockSearchAll` were added to allow searching blocks in
  Tendermint 0.34.9+ backends. This is a backport of [#815]. Note: Decoding
  blocks of height 1 is unsupported. This is fixed in [#815] and will be
  released as part of CosmJS 0.26.

[#815]: https://github.com/cosmos/cosmjs/pull/815

## [0.25.4] - 2021-05-31

  security problems.

## [0.25.3] - 2021-05-18

### Fixed

- @cosmjs/cosmwasm-stargate, @cosmjs/stargate: Fix error propagation in
  `CosmWasmClient.broadcastTx` and `StargateClient.broadcastTx` ([#800]). This
  bug was introduced with the switch from broadcast mode "commit" to "sync" in
  version 0.25.0.
- @cosmjs/launchpad, @cosmjs/stargate: Avoid the use of named capture groups in
  `GasPrice.fromString` to restore ES2017 compatibility and make the library
  work with Hermes ([#801]; thanks [@AlexBHarley]).
- @cosmjs/launchpad: Adapt `GasPrice.fromString` denom pattern to Cosmos SDK
  0.39 rules: reduce denom length to 16 and allow digits in denom.

## [0.25.1] - 2021-05-06

### Added

- @cosmjs/cosmwasm-stargate: Export types `Code`, `CodeDetails`, `Contract`,
  `ContractCodeHistoryEntry` and `JsonObject` which are response types of
  `CosmWasmClient` methods. Export types `ChangeAdminResult`, `ExecuteResult`,
  `InstantiateOptions`, `InstantiateResult`, `MigrateResult`, `UploadMeta` and
  `UploadResult` which are argument or response types of `SigningCosmWasmClient`
  methods.

### Fixed

- @cosmjs/cosmwasm-stargate: Use `CosmWasmFeeTable` instead of `CosmosFeeTable`
  in `SigningCosmWasmClientOptions`; export type `CosmWasmFeeTable`.
- @cosmjs/amino, @cosmjs/cli, @cosmjs/ledger-amino, @cosmjs/proto-signing: Fix
  runtime error caused by passing explicitly undefined options.

## [0.25.0] - 2021-05-05

### Added

- @cosmjs/cosmwasm-launchpad: Expose `SigningCosmWasmClient.fees`.
- @cosmjs/cosmwasm-stargate: Expose `SigningCosmWasmClient.fees` and
  `SigningCosmWasmClient.registry`.
- @cosmjs/launchpad: Expose `SigningCosmosClient.fees`.
- @cosmjs/stargate: Expose `SigningStargateClient.fees` and
  `SigningStargateClient.registry`.
- @cosmjs/stargate: Add support for different account types in `accountFromAny`
  and `StargateClient`. Added `ModuleAccount` and vesting accounts
  `BaseVestingAccount`, `ContinuousVestingAccount`, `DelayedVestingAccount` and
  `PeriodicVestingAccount`.
- @cosmjs/stargate: Add codecs for IBC channel tx, client query/tx, and
  connection tx, as well as Tendermint.
- @cosmjs/stargate: Add support for IBC message types in
  `SigningStargateClient`.
- @cosmjs/stargate: Added new `logs` export with all the functionality from
  @cosmjs/launchpad.
- @cosmjs/stargate: Added new `Coin`, `coin`, `coins` and `parseCoins` exports
  which have the same functionality as already existed in @cosmjs/launchpad.
- @cosmjs/amino: New package created that contains the shared amino signing
  functionality for @cosmjs/launchpad and @cosmjs/stargate.
- @cosmjs/amino: Split public key interfaces into `Pubkey`, `SinglePubkey` and
  `Secp256k1Pubkey` where `Pubkey` is a generalization of the old `PubKey` that
  supported nested pubkeys for multisig. `SinglePubkey` is the old `PubKey` in
  which the `value` is a base64 encoded string. And `Secp256k1Pubkey` is a
  single secp256k1 pubkey.
- @cosmjs/utils: The new `arrayContentStartsWith` works similar to
  `arrayContentEquals` but only checks the start of an array.
- @cosmjs/proto-signing: Added new `Coin`, `coin`, `coins` and `parseCoins`
  exports which have the same functionality as already existed in
  @cosmjs/launchpad.
- @cosmjs/stargate: Add `SigningStargateClient.sign`, which allows you to create
  signed transactions without broadcasting them directly. The new type

  `DirectSecp256k1HdWalletOptions` argument which includes an array of `hdPaths`
  instead of a single `hdPath`. `DirectSecp256k1HdWallet.generate` now also
  accepts options via this interface. This adds support for multiple accounts
  from the same mnemonic to `DirectSecp256k1HdWallet`.

- @cosmjs/sdk38: Rename `CosmosSdkAccount` to `BaseAccount` and export the type.
- @cosmjs/sdk38: `BaseAccount` now uses `number | string` as the type for
  `account_number` and `sequence`. The new helpers `uint64ToNumber` and
  `uint64ToString` allow you to normalize the mixed input.
- @cosmjs/sdk38: `BaseAccount` now uses `string | PubKey | null` as the type for
  `public_key`. The new helper `normalizePubkey` allows you to normalize the
