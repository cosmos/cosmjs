## [Unreleased]

## [0.30.1] - 2023-03-22

### Fixed

- @cosmjs/amino: Fix escaping of "&", "<" and ">" characters in Amino JSON
  encoding to match the Go implementation ([#1373], [#1388]).
- @cosmjs/tendermint-rpc: Move version check from
  `Tendermint{34,37}Client.create` to `.connect` in order to allow creating
  clients without performing the extra network request ([#1358]).
- @cosmjs/cli, @cosmjs/faucet: Add missing `bin/` directory to the
  package.json's `files` list to ship it as part of the released package.

[#1388]: https://github.com/cosmos/cosmjs/pull/1388

## [0.30.0] - 2023-03-09

### Changed

- all: The TypeScript compilation target is now ES2020 ([#1002]).
- all: Add full support for Node.js 18 and run all CI tests with it ([#1240]).
- all: Upgrade cosmjs-types to 0.7.
- @cosmjs/tendermint-rpc: Remove unused `index` field from `RpcTxEvent` and
  `TxEvent`. This is unset starting with Tendermint 0.34.
- @cosmjs/proto-signing: Make input and output of `decodePubkey` non-optional
  ([#1289]).
- @cosmjs/stargate: Remove unnecessary address prefix argument from
  `createStakingAminoConverters`. This made `prefix` in
  `SigningCosmWasmClientOptions` and `SigningStargateClientOptions` obsolete, so
  this was also deleted. ([#1291])
- @cosmjs/proto-signing: Remove `fromJSON`/`toJSON` from `TsProtoGeneratedType`
  such that generated types are not required to generate those anymore. The
  methods were provided by ts-proto but we never needed them. ([#1329])
- @cosmjs/stargate: Rename `fromTendermint34Event` to `fromTendermintEvent` and
  let it support both Tendermint 0.34 and 0.37 events as input.
- @cosmjs/cosmwasm-stargate: Remove `cosmWasmTypes`. Use
  `createWasmAminoConverters()` instead.
- @cosmjs/encoding: Remove previously deprecated `Bech32` class. Please replace
  `Bech32.encode`/`.decode` with free the functions `toBech32`/`fromBech32`.
- @cosmjs/cosmwasm-stargate: Changed the `SigningCosmWasmClient` constructor to
  include all Amino type converters that the `SigningStargateClient` uses by
  default, to match the default registry types ([#1384]).

[#1384]: https://github.com/cosmos/cosmjs/pull/1384

### Added

- @cosmjs/stargate: Add `granteeGrants` and `granterGrants` queries to
  `AuthzExtension` ([#1308]).
- @cosmjs/tendermint-rpc: Add new `Tendermint37Client` and remove unused
  `Tendermint35Client`; Add `TendermintClient` as a union type for
  `Tendermint34Client` or `Tendermint37Client` and
  `isTendermint34Client`/`isTendermint37Client` to get the specific type
  ([#1376]).
- @cosmjs/stargate: Add constructors `StargateClient.create` and
  `SigningStargateClient.createWithSigner` to construct with a given Tendermint
  client ([#1376]).
- @cosmjs/cosmwasm-stargate: Add constructors `CosmWasmClient.create` and
  `SigningCosmWasmClient.createWithSigner` to construct with a given Tendermint
  client ([#1376]).
- @cosmjs/cosmwasm-stargate: Add `instantiate2Address` to pre-calculate
  addresses for Instantiate2 ([#1253]).
- @cosmjs/stargate: Add `txIndex` to `DeliverTxResponse` and `IndexedTx`
  ([#1361]).
- @cosmjs/stargate: Add `createDefaultAminoConverters` to access the
  `SigningStargateClient`'s list of default Amino type converters to match the
  default registry types in `defaultStargateTypes` ([#1384]).

## [0.29.5] - 2022-12-07

### Fixed

- @cosmjs/stargate: Fix `protoDecimalToJson` for values with a 0 fractional
  part, such as `0.000000000000000000`, `1.000000000000000000` or
  `42.000000000000000000` ([#1326]).

[#1326]: https://github.com/cosmos/cosmjs/pull/1326

### Changed

- @cosmjs/crypto: `getSubtle()` does not use `getCryptoModule()` anymore to find
  a subtle implementation. Turns out all environments we support have subtle in
  `globalThis` or do not have it at all ([#1307], [#1340]).

[#1307]: https://github.com/cosmos/cosmjs/pull/1307
[#1340]: https://github.com/cosmos/cosmjs/pull/1340

### Deprecated

- @cosmjs/stargate: Deprecate `QueryClient.queryUnverified` in favour of newly
  added `QueryClient.queryAbci`.
- @cosmjs/stargate: Deprecate `QueryClient.queryVerified` in favour of newly
  added `QueryClient.queryStoreVerified`.

## [0.29.4] - 2022-11-15

### Added

- @cosmjs/tendermint-rpc: The options in the `HttpBatchClient` constructor are
  now of type `Partial<HttpBatchClientOptions>`, allowing you to set only the
  fields you want to change ([#1309]).
- @cosmjs/tendermint-rpc: Add missing exports `HttpBatchClient`,
  `HttpBatchClientOptions`, `RpcClient` ([#1311]).
- @cosmjs/tendermint-rpc: Send batch immediately when full in `HttpBatchClient`
  ([#1310]).

[#1310]: https://github.com/cosmos/cosmjs/issues/1310
[#1311]: https://github.com/cosmos/cosmjs/issues/1311

### Fixed

- @cosmjs/cosmwasm-stargate: Fix `ContractCodeHistory` decoding when msg
  contains non-printable ASCII ([#1320]).
- @cosmjs/crypto: Bump elliptic version to ^6.5.4 due to
  [CVE-2020-28498](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-r9p9-mrjm-926w).

[#1320]: https://github.com/cosmos/cosmjs/pull/1320

## [0.29.3] - 2022-10-25

### Added

- @cosmjs/tendermint-rpc: Add `HttpBatchClient`, which implements `RpcClient`,
  supporting batch RPC requests ([#1300]).
- @cosmjs/encoding: Add `lossy` parameter to `fromUtf8` allowing the use of a
  replacement charater instead of throwing.
- @cosmjs/stargate: Add structured `Events`s to `IndexTx.events` and
  `DeliverTxResponse.events`.
- @cosmjs/cosmwasm-stargate: Add structured `Events`s field to
  `SigningCosmWasmClient`s transaction execution methods.

### Fixed

- @cosmjs/stargate: Fix Amino JSON encoding of the unset case of
  `commission_rate` and `min_self_delegation` in
  `MsgEditValidator`/`AminoMsgEditValidator`.

## [0.29.2] - 2022-10-13

### Added

- @cosmjs/amino: Add `encodeEd25519Pubkey` analogue to the existing
  `encodeSecp256k1Pubkey`.
- @cosmjs/proto-signing: Add Ed25519 support to `encodePubkey` and
  `anyToSinglePubkey`. Export `anyToSinglePubkey`.
- @cosmjs/utils: Add `isDefined` which checks for `undefined` in a
  TypeScript-friendly way.
- @cosmjs/stargate: Add missing `{is,}MsgBeginRedelegateEncodeObject`,
  `{is,MsgCreateValidatorEncodeObject}` and `{is,MsgEditValidatorEncodeObject}`.

[#1300]: https://github.com/cosmos/cosmjs/pull/1300

### Fixed

- @cosmjs/cosmwasm-stargate: Use type `JsonObject = any` for smart query
  requests and messages (in `WasmExtension.wasm.queryContractSmart`,
  `CosmWasmClient.queryContractSmart`, `SigningCosmWasmClient.instantiate`,
  `SigningCosmWasmClient.migrate`, `SigningCosmWasmClient.execute`). This
  reverts the type change done in CosmJS 0.23.0. ([#1281], [#1284])
- @cosmjs/cosmwasm-stargate: `AminoMsgCreateValidator` and
  `createStakingAminoConverters` were fixed after testing both
  `MsgCreateValidator` and `MsgEditValidator` in sign mode direct and Amino JSON
  ([#1290]).

### Added

- @cosmjs/stargate: Add `makeMultisignedTxBytes` which is like
  `makeMultisignedTx` but returns bytes ready to broadcast ([#1176]).
- @cosmjs/tendermint-rpc: Add Tendermint 0.35 client (private, unusable). This
  is currently not used by higher level clients as Cosmos SDK 0.42-0.46 use
  Tendermint 0.34. It may become public or evolve into a Tendermint 0.36+ client
  from here. If you need this client, please comment in [#1225] or open a new
  issue. ([#1154] and [#1225])

  create Amino JSON converters) ([#1224]).
- @cosmjs/stargate: Add Amino JSON support for `MsgCreateVestingAccount`.
- @cosmjs/stargate and @cosmjs/cosmwasm-stargate: Create and use
  BroadcastTxError ([#1096]).

- all: Drop support for Node.js < 14.
- all: Use caret version for internal dependencies' version ranges ([#1254]).
- @cosmjs/stargate: Change `packetCommitment` parameter `sequence` type from
  `Long` to `number` ([#1168]).
- @cosmjs/tendermint-rpc: The type of `votingPower` fields was changed from

  payer argument in position 4 and 5.
- @cosmjs/stargate: Rename exported function `createFreegrantAminoConverters` to

[#1198]: https://github.com/cosmos/cosmjs/pull/1198

## [0.28.9] - 2022-06-21

This version replaces the 0.28.8 release which was erroneously tagged as 0.26.8
and released to npm under that wrong version. In order to avoid further
confusion we give up the .8 patch version. Users should install `^0.28.9` for
all `@cosmjs/*` packages to be safe. Users of `^0.26` should upgrade to a more
recent minor version if they run into trouble.

## [0.28.8] - 2022-06-21

- @cosmjs/tendermint-rpc: Fix decoding validator updates due to slashing
  ([#1177]).

  integer range.
- @cosmjs/cosmwasm-stargate, @cosmjs/stargate, @cosmjs/proto-signing: Upgrade
  protobufjs to 6.11.

### Fixed

- @cosmjs/tendermint-rpc: Fix block results validator update decoder. ([#1151])

[#1151]: https://github.com/cosmos/cosmjs/issues/1151

## [0.28.2] - 2022-04-07

### Added

- @cosmjs/encoding: Create `normalizeBech32`.
- @cosmjs/stargate: Added support for `MsgCreateVestingAccount` ([#1074]).
  Please note that Amino JSON signing is currently not available for this type

[#1074]: https://github.com/cosmos/cosmjs/issues/1074
[#1115]: https://github.com/cosmos/cosmjs/issues/1115

## [0.28.1] - 2022-03-30

### Added

- @cosmjs/stargate: Added the ability to specify a custom account parser for
  `StargateClient`

### Fixed

- @cosmjs/proto-signing: Add missing runtime dependencies @cosmjs/encoding and
  @cosmjs/utils.
- @cosmjs/tendermint-rpc: Add missing runtime dependency @cosmjs/utils.

## [0.28.0] - 2022-03-17

### Changed

- all: The TypeScript compilation target is now ES2018.
- @cosmjs/crypto: Add `Secp256k1.uncompressPubkey`.
- @cosmjs/crypto: Replace hashing implementations with @noble/hashes ([#960]).
- @cosmjs/faucet: Set default value of `FAUCET_GAS_LIMIT` to 100_000 to better
  support Cosmos SDK 0.45 chains.
- @cosmjs/stargate: The `AminoTypes` now always requires an argument of type
  `AminoTypesOptions`. This is an object with a required `prefix` field. Before
  the prefix defaulted to "cosmos" but this is almost never the right choice for
  CosmJS users that need to add Amino types manually. ([#989])
- @cosmjs/cosmwasm-stargate: `height`, `gasWanted` and `gasUsed` have been added
  to all result types of `SigningCosmWasmClient`
- @cosmjs/stargate: `MsgSend` and `Coin` are now parts of
  `defaultRegistryTypes`. ([#994])
- @cosmjs/proto-signing: `Registry`'s constructor can now override default
  types. ([#994])
- @cosmjs/tendermint-rpc: The property `evidence` in the interface `Block` is
  now non-optional. ([#1011])
- @cosmjs/stargate: Added the following message types to stargate's
  `defaultRegistryTypes`: ([#1026])
  - cosmos.authz.v1beta1.MsgGrant
  - cosmos.authz.v1beta1.MsgExec
  - cosmos.authz.v1beta1.MsgRevoke
  - cosmos.feegrant.v1beta1.MsgGrantAllowance
  - cosmos.feegrant.v1beta1.MsgRevokeAllowance
- @cosmjs/stargate: In `AminoTypes` the uniqueness of the Amino type identifier
  is checked in `fromAmino` now instead of the constructor. This only affects
  you if multiple different protobuf type URLs map to the same Amino type
  identifier which should not be the case anyways.
- @cosmjs/stargate: Added support for slashing queries ([#927])
- @cosmjs/ledger-amino: Renamed `LaunchpadLedger` to `LedgerConnector` ([#955])
- @cosmjs/encoding: Created `toBech32()` and `fromBech32()`. Class Bech32 is now
  deprecated and should not longer be used. ([#1053])
- @cosmjs/crypto: Use a custom BIP-39 implementation to reduce external
  dependencies. This should also reduce the bundle size as only the English
  wordlist is shipped. ([#966])
- @cosmjs/cli: Rename binary `cosmwasm-cli` to `cosmjs-cli` ([#1033]).
- @cosmjs/stargate: Added Authz queries. ([#1080]).
- @cosmjs/stargate & @cosmjs/cosmwasm-stargate: Removed default types from
  AminoTypes. ([#1079])
- @cosmjs/cosmwasm-stargate: getCodes() automatically loops through all
  pagination pages now. ([#1077])
- @cosmjs/stargate & @cosmjs/cosmwasm-stargate: Timeout Errors shows more
  relevant information about the timeout. ([#1066])

### Removed

- @cosmjs/crypto: Remove the SHA1 implementation (`Sha1` and `sha1`) as it is
  not used in the Cosmos tech stack and not implemented in the hashing lib we
  want to migrate to ([#1003]). Also it has known weaknesses.
- @cosmjs/launchpad: Package was removed as no support for Cosmos SDK 0.37-0.39
  is needed anymore ([#947]).

[#947]: https://github.com/cosmos/cosmjs/issues/947
[#1003]: https://github.com/cosmos/cosmjs/issues/1003

## [0.27.1] - 2022-01-26

### Added

- @cosmjs/cosmwasm-stargate: Add `fromBinary`/`toBinary` to convert between
  JavaScript objects and the JSON representation of `cosmwasm_std::Binary`
  (base64).
- @cosmjs/cosmwasm-stargate: Export `WasmExtension` and `setupWasmExtension`.
- @cosmjs/ledger-amino: Added `LedgerSigner.showAddress` and
  `LaunchpadLedger.showAddress` to show the user's address in the Ledger screen.

### Changed

- @cosmjs/stargate: The error messages for missing types in `AminoTypes` now
  contain the type that was searched for ([#990]).
- @cosmjs/tendermint-rpc: Change the `Evidence` type to `any` and avoid decoding
  it. The structure we had before was outdated and trying to decode it led to
  exceptions at runtime when a block with actual values was encountered.
  ([#980])

- @cosmjs/stargate: Created initial `MintExtension`.
- @cosmjs/stargate: Created `types.Dec` decoder function
  `decodeCosmosSdkDecFromProto`.
- @cosmjs/amino: Added `StdTx`, `isStdTx` and `makeStdTx` and removed them from
  @cosmjs/launchpad. They are re-exported in @cosmjs/launchpad for backwards
  compatibility.
- @cosmjs/stargate: Add `GasPrice.toString`.

### Fixed

- @cosmjs/tendermint-rpc: Add missing `BlockSearchResponse` case to `Response`.

### Changed

- @cosmjs/stargate: Remove verified queries from `AuthExtension` and
  `BankExtension` as well as `StargateClient.getAccountVerified` because the
  storage layout is not stable across multiple Cosmos SDK releases. Verified
  queries remain available in the `IbcExtension` because for IBC the storage
  layout is standardized. Such queries can still be implemented in CosmJS caller
  code that only needs to support one backend. ([#865])
- @cosmjs/tendermint-rpc: Remove default URL from `HttpClient` and
  `WebsocketClient` constructors ([#897]).
- all: Upgrade cosmjs-types to 0.4. This includes the types of the Cosmos SDK
  0.44 modules x/authz and x/feegrant. It causes a few breaking changes by
  adding fields to interfaces as well as changing `Date` to a `Timestamp`
  object. ([#928])
- @cosmjs/stargate and @cosmjs/cosmwasm-stargate: Add simulation support
  ([#931]).
- @cosmjs/cosmwasm-stargate: Rename `BroadcastTx{Success,Failure}` to
  `DeliverTx{Success,Failure}`, `BroadcastTxResponse` to `DeliverTxResponse`,
  `isBroadcastTx{Success,Failure}` to `isDeliverTx{Success,Failure}` and
  `assertIsBroadcastTxSuccess` to `assertIsDeliverTxSuccess`. ([#946])
- @cosmjs/tendermint-rpc: Remove `Tendermint33Client` and related symbols.
- @cosmjs/cosmwasm-stargate: Add support for wasmd 0.21. This changes the AMINO
  JSON representation of `Msg{Execute,Instantiate,Migrate}Contract.msg` from
  base64 strings to JSON objects. ([#948])
- @cosmjs/cli: Replace `colors` dependency with `chalk` (see
  https://snyk.io/blog/open-source-npm-packages-colors-faker/)

### Deprecated

- @cosmjs/stargate: The verified queries from `AuthExtension` and
  `BankExtension` as well as `StargateClient.getAccountVerified` are deprecated
  and will be removed in 0.27 ([#910]).

[#910]: https://github.com/cosmos/cosmjs/pull/910

## [0.26.2] - 2021-10-12

### Fixed

- @cosmjs/stargate: remove extra space in messageTimeout registry.
- @cosmjs/cosmwasm-stargate: Fix Amino JSON representation of
  `MsgInstantiateContract`, `MsgMigrateContract` and `MsgExecuteContract` to
  match the wasmd expectation. This was broken since the wasmd upgrade to
  Stargate such that no Ledger signing was possible for those message types in
  the meantime.

## [0.26.1] - 2021-09-30

### Added

- @cosmjs/amino: `decodeBech32Pubkey` and `decodeAminoPubkey` now support

- @cosmjs/cosmwasm-stargate: Export `isValidBuilder`, which is a clone of
  `isValidBuilder` from @cosmjs/cosmwasm-launchpad.
- @cosmjs/cosmwasm-stargate: Copy symbols `Code`, `CodeDetails`, `Contract`,
  `ContractCodeHistoryEntry` and `JsonObject` from @cosmjs/cosmwasm-launchpad
  and remove dependency on @cosmjs/cosmwasm-launchpad.

  `tendermint34.Block.lastCommit` optional to better handle the case of height 1
  where there is no previous block.
- @cosmjs/proto-signing: `makeAuthInfoBytes` now takes an array of pubkey
  sequence pairs in order to support different sequences for different signers.
- @cosmjs/cosmwasm-stargate: Upgraded client to support wasmd 0.18 backends.
  Other backends are not supported anymore. Update proto types from
  `cosmwasm.wasm.v1beta1.*` to `cosmwasm.wasm.v1.*`. `MsgStoreCode.source` and

  only updated for the class `Tendermint34Client`, not for `Client`. Please
  migrate to the former.
- @cosmjs/launchpad: `rawSecp256k1PubkeyToAddress` was removed. Instead use

- @cosmjs/cosmwasm: Rename `CosmWasmClient.postTx` method to `.broadcastTx`.
- @cosmjs/cosmwasm: Rename `FeeTable` type to `CosmWasmFeeTable`.
- @cosmjs/cosmwasm: `SigningCosmWasmClient` constructor now takes optional
  arguments `gasPrice` and `gasLimits` instead of `customFees` for easier
  customization.
- @cosmjs/cosmwasm: Rename `SigningCosmWasmClient.signAndPost` method to
  `.signAndBroadcast`.
- @cosmjs/cosmwasm: Use stricter type `Record<string, unknown>` for smart query,
  init, migrate and handle messages (in `WasmExtension.wasm.queryContractSmart`,
  `CosmWasmClient.queryContractSmart`, `SigningCosmWasmClient.instantiate`,
  `SigningCosmWasmClient.migrate`, `SigningCosmWasmClient.execute`).
- @cosmjs/crypto: Export new type alias `HdPath`.
- @cosmjs/crypto: Add `Secp256k1Signature.toFixedLength` method.
- @cosmjs/demo-staking: Remove package and supporting scripts.
- @cosmjs/encoding: Add `limit` parameter to `Bech32.encode` and `.decode`. The
  new default limit for decoding is infinity (was 90 before). Set it to 90 to
  create a strict decoder.
- @cosmjs/faucet: Environmental variable `FAUCET_FEE` renamed to
  `FAUCET_GAS_PRICE` and now only accepts one token. Environmental variable
  `FAUCET_GAS` renamed to `FAUCET_GAS_LIMIT`.
- @cosmjs/faucet: `/credit` API now expects `denom` (base token) instead of
  `ticker` (unit token). Environmental variables specifying credit amounts now
  need to use uppercase denom.
- @cosmjs/launchpad: Rename `FeeTable` type to `CosmosFeeTable` and export a new
  more generic type `FeeTable`.
- @cosmjs/launchpad: Add new class `GasPrice`, new helper type `GasLimits` and
  new helper function `buildFeeTable` for easier handling of gas prices and
  fees.
- @cosmjs/launchpad: Rename `CosmosClient.postTx` method to `.broadcastTx`.
- @cosmjs/launchpad: `SigningCosmosClient` constructor now takes optional
  arguments `gasPrice` and `gasLimits` instead of `customFees` for easier
  customization.
- @cosmjs/launchpad: Rename `SigningCosmosClient.signAndPost` method to
  `.signAndBroadcast`.
- @cosmjs/launchpad: Rename `PostTx`-related types to `BroadcastTxResult`,
  `BroadcastTxSuccess` and `BroadcastTxFailure` respectively, as well as helper
  functions `isBroadcastTxFailure`, `isBroadcastTxSuccess` and
  `assertIsBroadcastTxSuccess`.
- @cosmjs/launchpad: Export `isSearchByIdQuery`, `isSearchByHeightQuery`,
  `isSearchBySentFromOrToQuery` and `isSearchByTagsQuery`.
- @cosmjs/launchpad: Change type of `TxsResponse.logs` and
  `BroadcastTxsResponse.logs` to `unknown[]`.
- @cosmjs/launchpad: Export `StdSignDoc` and create helpers to make and
  serialize a `StdSignDoc`: `makeSignDoc` and `serializeSignDoc`.
- @cosmjs/launchpad: Let `OfflineSigner.sign` take an `StdSignDoc` instead of an
  encoded message and return a `SignResponse` that includes the document which
  was signed.
- @cosmjs/launchpad: Remove `PrehashType` and the prehash type argument in
  `OfflineSigner.sign` because the signer now needs to know how to serialize an
  `StdSignDoc`.
- @cosmjs/launchpad: Remove `makeSignBytes` in favour of `makeSignDoc` and
  `serializeSignDoc`.
- @cosmjs/launchpad: Create `WrappedTx`, `WrappedStdTx` and `isWrappedStdTx` to
  better represent the Amino tx interface. Deprecate `CosmosSdkTx`, which is an
  alias for `WrappedStdTx`.
- @cosmjs/launchpad: Add `makeStdTx` to create an `StdTx`.
- @cosmjs/launchpad: Rename `Secp256k1Wallet` to `Secp256k1HdWallet`. Later on,
  we'll use `Secp256k1Wallet` for single key wallets.
- @cosmjs/launchpad-ledger: Add package supporting Ledger device integration for
  Launchpad. Two new classes are provided: `LedgerSigner` (for most use cases)
  and `LaunchpadLedger` for more fine-grained access.
- @cosmjs/math: Add `.multiply` method to `Decimal` class.
- @cosmjs/math: Deprecate `Uint32.fromBigEndianBytes` in favour of
  `Uint32.fromBytes`, which supports both big and little endian.
- @cosmjs/math: Deprecate `Uint64.fromBytesBigEndian` in favour of
  `Uint64.fromBytes`, which supports both big and little endian.
- @cosmjs/math: Add `Uint32.fromString`.
- @cosmjs/tendermint-rpc: Make `BroadcastTxCommitResponse.height` non-optional.
- @cosmjs/tendermint-rpc: Make `TxProof.proof.leafHash` non-optional because it
  is always set.
- @cosmjs/tendermint-rpc: Change type of `GenesisResponse.appState` to
  `Record<string, unknown> | undefined`.
- @cosmjs/tendermint-rpc: Remove obsolete `TxData.tags` and make `TxData.events`
  non-optional. Rename `Tag` to `Attribute`.
- @cosmjs/tendermint-rpc: Remove obsolete `BlockResultsResponse.beginBlock` and
  `.beginBlock`. The new `.beginBlockEvents` and `.endBlockEvents` now parse the
  events correctly.
- @cosmjs/tendermint-rpc: Remove trivial helpers `getTxEventHeight`,
  `getHeaderEventHeight` and `getBlockEventHeight` because they don't do
  anything else than accessing an object member.
- @cosmjs/tendermint-rpc: Add support for connecting to Tendermint RPC 0.34.
- @cosmjs/tendermint-rpc: Make `TxEvent.index` optional and deprecate it because
  it is not set anymore in Tendermint 0.34.
- @cosmjs/utils: Add `assertDefined`.
- @cosmjs/faucet: Rename binary from `cosmwasm-faucet` to `cosmos-faucet`.

## 0.22.3 (2020-09-15)

## 0.22.1 (2020-08-11)

- @cosmjs/cli: Import `encodeAminoPubkey`, `encodeBech32Pubkey`,
  `decodeAminoPubkey` and `decodeBech32Pubkey` by default.
- @cosmjs/launchpad: Add ed25519 support to `encodeBech32Pubkey`.
- @cosmjs/launchpad: Add `encodeAminoPubkey` and `decodeAminoPubkey`.

- @cosmjs/faucet: Add config variables `FAUCET_ADDRESS_PREFIX` and
  `FAUCET_TOKENS`.
- @cosmjs/faucet: Remove broken chain ID from `cosmwasm-faucet generate`.

## 0.22.0 (2020-08-03)

- @cosmjs/cli: Now supports HTTPs URLs for `--init` code sources.
- @cosmjs/cli: Now supports adding code directly via `--code`.
- @cosmjs/cosmwasm: Rename `CosmWasmClient.getNonce` method to `.getSequence`.
- @cosmjs/cosmwasm: Remove `RestClient` class in favour of new modular
  `LcdClient` class from @cosmjs/sdk38.
- @cosmjs/cosmwasm: Add `SigningCosmWasmClient.signAndPost` as a mid-level
  abstraction between `SigningCosmWasmClient.upload`/`.instantiate`/`.execute`
  and `.postTx`.
- @cosmjs/cosmwasm: Use `*PostTx*` types and helpers from @cosmjs/sdk38. Remove
  exported `PostTxResult`.
- @cosmjs/cosmwasm: `ContractDetails` was removed in favour of just `Contract`.
  The missing `init_msg` is now available via the contract's code history (see
  `getContractCodeHistory`).
- @cosmjs/cosmwasm: Remove `SigningCallback` in favour of the `OfflineSigner`
  interface.
- @cosmjs/sdk38: Rename `CosmosClient.getNonce` method to `.getSequence`.
- @cosmjs/sdk38: Remove `RestClient` class in favour of new modular `LcdClient`
  class.
- @cosmjs/sdk38: Remove `Pen` type in favour of `OfflineSigner` and remove
  `Secp256k1Pen` class in favour of `Secp256k1Wallet` which takes an
  `OfflineSigner` instead of a `SigningCallback`.
- @cosmjs/sdk38: Rename `CosmosSdkAccount` to `BaseAccount` and export the type.
- @cosmjs/sdk38: `BaseAccount` now uses `number | string` as the type for
  `account_number` and `sequence`. The new helpers `uint64ToNumber` and
  `uint64ToString` allow you to normalize the mixed input.
- @cosmjs/sdk38: `BaseAccount` now uses `string | PubKey | null` as the type for
  `public_key`. The new helper `normalizePubkey` allows you to normalize the
  mixed input.
- @cosmjs/math: Add missing integer check to `Uint64.fromNumber`. Before
  `Uint64.fromNumber(1.1)` produced some result.
- @cosmjs/sdk38: Add `SigningCosmosClient.signAndPost` as a mid-level
  abstraction between `SigningCosmosClient.sendTokens` and `.postTx`.
- @cosmjs/sdk38: Export `PostTxFailure`/`PostTxSuccess` and type checkers
  `isPostTxFailure`/`isPostTxSuccess`; export `assertIsPostTxSuccess`.
- @cosmjs/sdk38: `Secp256k1Wallet`s can now be generated randomly with
  `Secp256k1Wallet.generate(n)` where `n` is 12, 15, 18, 21 or 24 mnemonic
  words.
- @cosmjs/sdk38: The new `Secp256k1Wallet.serialize` and `.deserialize` allow
  encrypted serialization of the wallet.
- @cosmjs/sdk38: Remove the obsolete `upload`, `init`, `exec` properties from
  `FeeTable`. @cosmjs/cosmwasm has its own `FeeTable` with those properties.
- @cosmjs/sdk38: Rename package to @cosmjs/launchpad.
