@iov/stream are some helper methods and classes to ceal with stream processing.
As BCP's `BlockchainConnection` exposes a Stream based event API, and
tendermint/RpcClient exposes Stream based subscriptions, there is common useful
functionality for creating and consuming streams both in applications as well as
in the test code.
