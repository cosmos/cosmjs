# @cosmjs/tendermint-rpc

[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@cosmjs/tendermint-rpc.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cosmjs/tendermint-rpc)

This package provides a type-safe wrapper around
[Tendermint RPC](https://docs.tendermint.com/master/rpc/). Notably, all binary
data is passed in and out as `Uint8Array`, and this module is responsible for
the hex/base64 encoding/decoding depending on the field and version of
Tendermint. Also handles converting numbers to and from strings.
